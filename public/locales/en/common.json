  "aboutMeProfile": "Started my career as a web engineer, consistently handling everything from design to implementation and operation in multiple BtoB/BtoC web app developments. I am a full-stack engineer capable of working across a wide range of areas, including frontend development with React/Nuxt/TypeScript, backend/API development with Express/Python, and cloud infrastructure mainly on Azure. In addition to development, I have continuously contributed to technology selection, architecture design, CI/CD improvements, and productivity/quality enhancements. I also have experience leading small teams, promoting Scrum events, and conducting code reviews. At Microsoft Japan, I solved many technical issues as a PaaS support engineer for Azure App Service, acquiring communication skills for a wide range of users, including non-engineers. This experience is now utilized in requirements definition, specification adjustments, and customer communication. Currently, I am leading workflow improvements using AI and the introduction of AI features into products, focusing on maximizing team productivity and developing features directly linked to business value.",
